# My first blog post
Welcome to _my blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I'll share my journey learning Astro!

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages` folder.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my fist blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next?

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space!
